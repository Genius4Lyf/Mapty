ACTION ITEMS ON MAPTY APP
1, make research on openstreetmap theme/Google theme map for code (EXPLORING THE APP)

2, A unique identifier should be given to an object created. In the real world, a library is usually used to create good and unique id numbers. MAKE A RESEARCH ON THAT.

3, understand the .closest() method use on the \_moveToPopup method and underStand event Delegation

4, understand why dataset is used on html attributes

5, check out the .setView on the leaflet documentation

6, Understand the concept of working with local storage

7, Delegation: Understand the concept of code delegation on methods and eventHandlers

8, Regularly used Web Development / Browser APIs,

9, UnderStand Location.Reload

POINT TAKEN:
I noticed that that \_newWorkout() contains few codes in it and some methods which was created outside that gets called in it.(Delegation: Understand the concept of code delegation on methods and eventHandlers) it is a good practice to keep your code clean

The App Constructor is where we have all the codes that is executed right when the apps load

Whenever we convert our OBJECT to a STRING and then BACK from the STRING to OBJECT. The PROTOTYPE CHAIN WILL BE LOST and the new OBJECT that was gotten from the local storage does not contain the PROTOTYPE CHAIN and so the OBJECT are now just regular OBJECTS. They are no longer OBJECTS that are created by the RUNNING / CYCLING CLASS and therefore they will not be able to inherit their class and so workout.clicks will no longer work. This can be a big problem when working with local Storage and OOP.
